I am currently 19 years old and working towards getting a job in the film industry. I chose this course because I love photography, film, and creating things.

            <h2>More About Me</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was young, I have always been fascinated with creating and bringing ideas to life. Drawing was one of my earliest passions, and I spent hours sketching characters, scenes, and stories from my imagination. As I grew older, I developed a deep interest in animation, realizing that it was a powerful way to make my creations move and interact. The ability to breathe life into characters through movement and expression became something I truly loved. Over time, my artistic interests expanded into different creative fields, including photography and film, allowing me to explore visual storytelling in new ways. I find great joy in capturing moments and crafting narratives that evoke emotions and meaning. Pursuing this passion has led me to study MMPT, where I am eager to refine my skills and explore the endless possibilities in digital media and animation. My dream is to one day work in the film or animation industry, creating stories that inspire others just as much as they have inspired me.</p>

Moving forward, I aim to deepen my skills in character animation and digital filmmaking, mastering tools and techniques to create more dynamic, lifelike animations.
